/**
 * The peer list of [KeySharingBottomSheet] for one key: every paired device,
 * whether it holds a grant, and whether the user may change that.
 *
 * Read from the `key_sharing_policies` rows and the paired-device store
 * themselves, so a change made elsewhere (a grant cleanup, another screen, a
 * device pairing while the sheet is open) reaches the sheet.
 *
 * A peer whose grant revocation is still pending (#174: unpaired, then
 * paired again before the cleanup finished) is shown unselected and not
 * selectable, whatever rows it still has, and a grant for it is refused:
 * the cleanup would delete it. The list updates when the revocation
 * completes. A grant is bound to the pairing it was checked against
 * ([PairedDeviceRepository.writeGrant]): one that lands after that pairing
 * ended authorizes nothing and is deleted.
 *
 * The grant protocol commits prefs synchronously, so it runs on
 * [ioDispatcher], never on the sheet's Main caller.
